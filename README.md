# Nightly Builds
**Admincore's nightly builds are not made for production. Check out Admincore's [releases](https://github.com/RudRecciah/admincore/releases) for those.**

Admincore releases nightly builds which anyone can download and use. While they're not recommended to use in production, they might be useful in some cases. You can find them here, labeled by their Spigot version.
